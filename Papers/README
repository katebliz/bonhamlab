This is where we can upload papers about different topics related to projects. 
If possible, please attempt to keep them organized and named in a way that makes it easy for people to navigate. For example:
1) Rename papers with the author, journal, and year (e.g. "Bonham et al, NEJM, 2016")
2) Place the paper in a relevant folder (e.g. "Precision Medicine" or "Omics Methods")
We can create as many folders and subfolders as we want, so go wild! Just as long as you can find things when you need them...
